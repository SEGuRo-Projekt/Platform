# This file contains an example job specification

# A list of triggers which cause the job to be executed if
# an object is created or removed from the data store at the
# given prefix
#
# Note: Jobs without configured triggers will be started
#       immediately when the scheduler is started.

triggers:
  # Each triggers ID via passed in the SEGURO_JOB_INFO environment variable
  # to the spawned container
  - id: measurements-received-ms1

    # The triggers type can be on of:
    # - created
    # - removed
    # - modified
    # - schedule
    # - startup
    # - shutdown
    type: created

    # Triggers of type 'created' or 'removed' can specify
    # a prefix to restrict which modified objects will trigger the
    # job to be executed.
    prefix: data/measurements/ms_1/

  - id: removed-data
    type: removed
    prefix: data/ba/

  - id: schedule-every-5-seconds
    type: schedule

    # Run the job every 'interval' of 'units'
    #
    # Defaults to 1
    interval: 5

    # Unit of time interval
    # Should be one of:
    # - seconds
    # - minutes
    # - hours
    # - days
    # - weeks
    #
    # Defaults to 'seconds'
    unit: seconds

    # Day of the week for weekly jobs
    #
    # Defaults to 'monday'
    start_day: monday

    # Schedule the job to run at an irregular (randomized) interval.
    # The jobâ€™s interval will randomly vary from the value given to
    # every to latest. The range defined is inclusive on both ends.
    # For example:
    #
    #   unit: seconds
    #   interval: A
    #   interval_to: B
    #
    # Executes the job function every N seconds such that A <= N <= B.
    #
    # Defaults to 'interval'
    interval_to: 10

    # Run the job exactly once
    #
    # Defaults to false
    once: true

    # Specify a particular time that the job should be run at.
    #
    # A string in one of the following formats:
    # - For daily jobs -> HH:MM:SS or HH:MM
    # - For hourly jobs -> MM:SS or :MM
    # - For minute jobs -> :SS
    # The format must make sense given how often the job is repeating;
    # for example, a job that repeats every minute should not be given
    # a string in the form HH:MM:SS. The difference between :MM and :SS
    # is inferred from the selected time-unit.
    #
    # Defaults to the beginning of the respective 'unit'
    at: 11:11

    # Schedule job to run until the specified moment.
    #
    # The job is canceled whenever the next run is calculated and it
    # turns out the next run is after 'until'.
    # The job is also canceled right before it runs, if the current
    # time is after until_time.
    # This latter case can happen when the the job was scheduled to
    # run before 'until', but runs after until_time.
    #
    # Jobs run indefinitely by default.
    until: 2024-02-06 09:09

# An optional number which determines how many instances of the container
# shall be started.
